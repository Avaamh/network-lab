# Bachelor's Project - Network & Security Lab

This project is my bachelor's final semester project.  
It simulates a small IT infrastructure with **4 virtual machines**:

1. **Router VM** – acts as gateway and firewall  
2. **Server VM** – provides LDAP, Samba file sharing, DNS  
3. **Attacker VM** – used for penetration testing and security hardening  
4. **Zabbix VM** – monitoring system to watch all other machines  

## Tools and Technologies
- Linux (Rocky Linux, Ubuntu)
- Ansible (automation)
- LDAP (centralized authentication)
- Samba (file sharing)
- DNS server
- Firewall (iptables/nftables)
- Zabbix (monitoring)

## Project Goals
- Learn and demonstrate Linux system administration skills
- Show network service configuration
- Practice monitoring and security
- Create a portfolio project for future IT administrator jobs
